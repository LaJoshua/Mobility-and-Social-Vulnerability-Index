# Mobility-and-Social-Vulnerability-Index

<h1>Welcome to the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) Project</h1>
<p>The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) is a powerful tool designed to assess the potential risks to lives and livelihoods within a community when confronted with various external stressors. These stressors can include manmade or natural disasters, and especially pandemics. The SVI draws on 16 key community variables derived from the American Community Survey, encompassing aspects like socioeconomic status, household characteristics, racial and ethnic minority status, housing conditions, and transportation characteristics.</p>
<p>Our project builds on the work of experts, including research by the CDC/ATSDR and studies conducted by Fox et al. in 2023 and Mah et al. in 2023. Their research underlines the significance of SVI in understanding the impact of events like COVID-19. Fox et al. (2023) demonstrated that the effects of COVID-19 disproportionately burdened areas with high SVI scores. These areas were often concentrated in historically disadvantaged regions, such as the Eastern Crescent.</p>
<p>Our project also leverages mobility data from 2019 and 2020, generously provided by SafeGraph. This data allows us to explore how mobility patterns within communities changed in response to pandemic-related restrictions.</p>
<p>Join us on this journey to better understand and address the social vulnerabilities that affect our communities. Together, we can work towards creating a more resilient and equitable future.</p>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<p>
Based on our calculations, for the Month of April, 2020 there is a statistically significant correlation between mobility and SVI, which Is dependent on mobility restrictions. Further analysis is needed to determine if this correlation was consistent during the entire timeframe impacted by COVID-19. We also showed areas of high vulnerability index are regional in Austin, with highest vulnerability noted in areas that are historically disadvantaged. Hospital facilities are almost exclusively located on areas of low vulnerability. â€‹
